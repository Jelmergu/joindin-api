Talks can represent more than just a talk, you may also find keynotes, tutorials, and social events masquerading under the heading of "talks".  There is no general talks collection, instead you can find talks by event or by speaker.

## Talk Format

When requesting a talk, you will receive a response like this (using sample data):

~~~~
talks:
    0:
        talk_title: Refactoring fantastic systems instead of NoSQL
        url_friendly_talk_title: refactoring-fantastic-systems-instead-of-nosql

## Creating New Talks

To create a talk, you actually need to make a POST request to the *talks collection of the event* that the session belongs to, and send the data in JSON format in the body of the request.  The user making the request must be authenticated and have permissions to create a talk here - either by being a site administrator, or by being a host on the event itself.

The following fields are understood:

*  ``talk_title``: The title of the talk
*  ``talk_description``: Detail about the talk or session (usually the talk abstract)
*  ``language``: One of the following:
     - English - US

     - Nederlands          
     - Francais            
     - Espanol             
     - Polish              
     - Finnish             
     - Brazilian Portuguese

*  ``speakers``: An array of names of speakers (still an array if there is only one speaker)
*  ``duration``: The length of the session in minutes (usually including breaks, so start_date plus duration gives end time)
*  ``slides_link``: URL to the slides for this talk

## Editing a Talk

To edit a talk, the user needs to be authenticated and be either a site admin, a host of the event or an approved speaker of the talk. You should send a PUT request to the URL in the talk's `uri` field containing the same fields as for creating a talk.

Curl example:

<pre class="embedcurl">curl -v -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer f9b4f1a9b30bdc0d" {{ site.apiurl }}/v2.1/talks/76 --data '{"talk_title":"Interesting Talk", "talk_description": "This talk is about interesting things", "start_date": "2013-11-24 14:00", "duration": "60", "slides_link": "", "type": "Talk", "language": "English - UK", "speakers": ["Jeffrey Montgomery"]}'
</pre>

~~~~

> Host: api.dev.joind.in
> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
> Content-Type: application/json
> Accept: application/json
> Authorization: Bearer f9b4f1a9b30bdc0d

< Location: http://api.dev.joind.in/v2.1/talks/12
< Vary: Accept-Encoding
< Content-Length: 0
< Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
<
~~~~

If successful, a 204 Accepted status will be returned along with a Location header pointing to the talk's URL.

Note that the list of speakers must be complete. Any speakers attached to the talk that are not in the `speakers` array will be removed from the talk.

## Finding a Talk

To find a talk, you can send a GET reqauest to the `talks`-URL and append the URL-encoded talk-title (or a part of it) as value to the `title`-parameter. 

Curl example:

<pre class="embedcurl">curl {{ site.apiurl }}/v2.1/talks?title=joind.in</pre>

This will return a list of all talks that have `joind.in` somewhere in the talk title. 

## Adding a Talk to a Track

To add a track to a talk, the user needs to be authenticated and be either a site admin, a host of the event or an approved speaker of the talk. You should send a POST request to the URL in the `tracks_uri` field of the event, with the body containing the `track_uri` field. The `track_uri` must be attached to the same event as the talk.

Curl example:

<pre class="embedcurl">curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer f9b4f1a9b30bdc0d" --data '{"track_uri": "{{ site.apiurl }}/v2.1/tracks/3"}' {{ site.apiurl }}/v2.1/talks/76/tracks
</pre>

If successful, a 201 Created status will be returned along with a Location header pointing back to the talk's URL.

## Removing a Talk from a Track

To remove a track from a talk, the user needs to be authenticated and be either a site admin, a host of the event or an approved speaker of the talk. You should send a DELETE request to the URL in the `remove_track_uri` field of the track listed in the tracks array of the talk representation.

Curl example:

<pre class="embedcurl">curl -v -X DELETE -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer f9b4f1a9b30bdc0d" {{ site.apiurl }}/v2.1/talks/76/tracks/3
</pre>

If successful, a 204 No Content status will be returned along with a Location header pointing back to the talk's URL.
